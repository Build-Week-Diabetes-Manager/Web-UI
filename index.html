                    <h3> Living A Healthy Life </h3>
                    <p> Our number one goal with the Diabetes Manager is to keep your nutrition, and blood sugar, in order. We take the "guessing" out of the equation. It's been proven that steady blood sugar levels result in longer lasting energy, greater focus, and a healthier system overall. Our mission as a company is to give you the power to input, and monitor, your blood sugar levels during all hours of the day. With your inputs, we can predict your future blood sugars, to keep you in a healthy range, all day, every day. </p>

                    <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). </p>

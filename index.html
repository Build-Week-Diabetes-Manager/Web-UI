Our mission as a company is to give you the power to input, and monitor, your blood sugar levels during all hours of the day. With your inputs, we can predict your future blood sugars, to keep you in a healthy range, all day, every day. </p>

                    <h3> As simple as 1, 2, 3! </h3>
                    <p> The process is short, and broken down into 3 simple steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li> Prior to eating a meal, input your food directly into the app. Select the <em>type of food</em>, <em>the amount</em>, and <em>the time of consumption</em>.</li>
                            <li> Be sure to log any exercise into the tracker. While it will count your daily steps, inputting any heavy amounts of exercise will allow it to provide a more accurate reading. </li>
                            <li> <em>That's it!</em> Simply log your food, and exercise, and the app will take care of the rest. That way you can send <em>less</em> time doing calculations, and <em>more</em> time enjoying your day... and food! </li>
                        </ol>
